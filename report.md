# An analysis of optimal Chinese restaurant investments in Singapore
### Introduction
Singapore has a modest population of around 5.6 million (as of 2018), with a population density of around 8358 individuals per square kilometer (as of 2020), which is incredibly high, even for a modern city. This means that the country is so populous that restaurants should draw in large amounts of people, if there aren't a huge number of them and disregarding any unexpected circumstances (such as a global pandemic). Furthermore, Singapore is so largely connected, and being only 50km in diameter means that restaurants would almost always find a crowd. Hence, one of the most important factors in deciding where to "set up shop" is the proximity of the restaurant in regards to other restaurants.
### Data
- Singapore is in itself a city. However, it can still be divided into smaller districts that are usually populated. The center coordinates of each district can be acquired through Google Maps.
- Restaurant data can be easily acquired through the Foursquare API. Since Singapore is such a small country, every Chinese Restaurant in the country can be found with one API call.
