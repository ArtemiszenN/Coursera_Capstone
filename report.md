# An analysis of optimal Chinese restaurant investments in Singapore
### Introduction
Singapore has a modest population of around 5.6 million (as of 2018), with a population density of around 8358 individuals per square kilometer (as of 2020), which is incredibly high, even for a modern city. This means that the country is so populous that restaurants should draw in large amounts of people, if there aren't a huge number of them and disregarding any unexpected circumstances (such as a global pandemic). Furthermore, Singapore is very connected, and being only 50km in diameter means that restaurants would almost always find a crowd. Hence, one of the most important factors in deciding where to "set up shop" is the proximity of the restaurant in regards to other restaurants.
### Data
- Singapore is in itself a city. However, it can still be divided into smaller districts that are usually populated. The center coordinates of each district can be acquired through Google Maps.
- Restaurant data can be easily acquired through the Foursquare API. Since Singapore is such a small country, every Chinese Restaurant in the country can be found with one API call.
### Data acquisition and cleaning
#### Data Sources
Data for this is easy enough to come by, as all we need is to do an API query on Foursquare from the middle of Singapore with a large enough radius (50km works), though this'll pick up non-Singaporean Chinese restaurants aswell. We'll discuss on how to deal with this in the next section
As for the districts, there is information all over the place on how to translate the postal code of a place to a district. Once again, we'll discuss on how to dela with this in the next section.
#### Data Cleaning
Once we make our Foursquare API request, we'll have to scroll through all the restaurants and drop any where the location.country tag is not set to 'Singapore'. 
Then, we'll have to extract the postal codes. Luckily, this is easy enough for most of the restaurants, but there were 3 where the postal codes were not listed, and hence the choice was made to manually input the postal codes instead of discarding that data.
Lastly, we'll have to translate those postal codes to the district numbers. There are 26 districts in Singapore, all of which can be determined from the first two numbers in the postal codes. However, this part is rather tedious as there aren't any switch-case statements in python, and creating a class with 80 different methods is certainly not better than using else-if statements. Luckily, for this dataset, while tedious elif statements can do the job. However, in larger datasets I would recommend using a direct address table, which, while slower to set up at first, would be quicker to manually populate and would hence be more efficient in larger datasets.
Once the districts are calculated, they can easily be added to the original dataset alongside the location of the restaurants.
#### Feature Selection
For this project, all we need are the names of the restaurants, their locations, and what districts they are in. Everything else can hence be pruned.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Relationship between district and restaurant counts

As seen from the image above, most of the restaurants in the country are located in District 1. However, this does not give us a clear image of the competition in the area as District 1 could be a huge area. Nevertheless, we can see that all other districts have much lower competition in terms of number of restaurants and would be much better targets to set up a new Chinese restaurant.
#### Relationship between space and restaurants

As seen from this image, it is true that most of the restaurants are in one location. However, in zooming into the image, it becomes rather clear why: many of those restaurants are in or near Chinatown. Not to mention, District 1 is a business district, and would hence experience traffic from those who are much more affluent, allowing profit margins to increase significantly. While this image already gives us a good idea as to where good opportunities are, we can further improve this by clustering the restaurants together.
#### Relationships between different restaurants
![DBSCAN of Chinese Restaurants](https://github.com/kyuuxyne/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/dbscan.JPG)
This image shows the clustering of restaurants. The colored dots are in their own clusters, while the black ones are outliers. The restaurants have been clustered here based on density as the primary deciding factor, as proximity is the largest factor as to deciding whether two brick and mortar stores are considered competitors. For this comparison, I have chosen a minimum cluster size of two, as even as little as two restaurants being in close proximity to each other could cause them to be competitors. As expected, there is the huge cluster near District 1, while there are two other clusters in the same size of the country. However, there lie many uncontested black outliers all over the country. Not only that, there are many residential districts such as Woodlands and Buangkok, not to mention places with huge traffic such as Changi Village and Harbourfront which do not have any listed Chinese Restaurants. Assuming that the data from Foursquare is correct, these two are definitely prime locations for anyone with the capital and interest to set up in, as they regularly see heavy traffic from those who would be considered affluent.
### Conclusions
While there exists heavy competition in some parts of the country, the business of Chinese Restaurants in the country is largely uncontested in the majority of the country. Given that Singapore is a majority Chinese country, it would be in the interest of business owners to seize these opportunities, especially the two mentioned in the above paragraph.
