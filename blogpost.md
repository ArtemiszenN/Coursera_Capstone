# An analysis of optimal Chinese restaurant investments in Singapore
### Introduction
Singapore has a modest population of around 5.6 million (as of 2018), with a population density of around 8358 individuals per square kilometer (as of 2020), which is incredibly high, even for a modern city. This means that the country is so populous that restaurants should draw in large amounts of people, if there aren't a huge number of them and disregarding any unexpected circumstances (such as a global pandemic). Furthermore, Singapore is very connected, and being only 50km in diameter means that restaurants would almost always find a crowd. Hence, one of the most important factors in deciding where to "set up shop" is the proximity of the restaurant in regards to other restaurants.
### Data
- Singapore is in itself a city. However, it can still be divided into smaller districts that are usually populated. The center coordinates of each district can be acquired through Google Maps.
- Restaurant data can be easily acquired through the Foursquare API. Since Singapore is such a small country, every Chinese Restaurant in the country can be found with one API call.
### Methodology
After an API request to Foursquare for all Chinese Restaurants in Singapore, all we need is to find the district numbers of those restaurants from their postal codes.
### Results
#### Relationship between district and restaurant counts

As seen from the image above, most of the restaurants in the country are located in District 1. However, this does not give us a clear image of the competition in the area as District 1 could be a huge area. Nevertheless, we can see that all other districts have much lower competition in terms of number of restaurants and would be much better targets to set up a new Chinese restaurant.
#### Relationship between space and restaurants

As seen from this image, it is true that most of the restaurants are in one location. However, in zooming into the image, it becomes rather clear why: many of those restaurants are in or near Chinatown. Not to mention, District 1 is a business district, and would hence experience traffic from those who are much more affluent, allowing profit margins to increase significantly. While this image already gives us a good idea as to where good opportunities are, we can further improve this by clustering the restaurants together.
#### Relationships between different restaurants

This image shows the clustering of restaurants. The colored dots are in their own clusters, while the black ones are outliers. The restaurants have been clustered here based on density as the primary deciding factor, as proximity is the largest factor as to deciding whether two brick and mortar stores are considered competitors. For this comparison, I have chosen a minimum cluster size of two, as even as little as two restaurants being in close proximity to each other could cause them to be competitors. As expected, there is the huge cluster near District 1, while there are two other clusters in the same size of the country. However, there lie many uncontested black outliers all over the country. Not only that, there are many residential districts such as Woodlands and Buangkok, not to mention places with huge traffic such as Changi Village and Harbourfront which do not have any listed Chinese Restaurants. Assuming that the data from Foursquare is correct, these two are definitely prime locations for anyone with the capital and interest to set up in, as they regularly see heavy traffic from those who would be considered affluent.
### Discussion
As mentioned, Singapore is a country with an insanely high population density. As such, many of the spots that do not contain any Chinese restaurants would be prime candidates. However, it is surprising that even some areas with heavy traffic do not contain a single Chinese restaurant.
### Conclusions
While there exists heavy competition in some parts of the country, the business of Chinese Restaurants in the country is largely uncontested in the majority of the country. Given that Singapore is a majority Chinese country, it would be in the interest of business owners to seize these opportunities, especially the two mentioned in the above paragraph.
